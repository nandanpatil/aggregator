1. Aggregate Me
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOAL: Create a simple file aggregator. It takes a list of files and clubs them into a single file while keeping track of individual files.

DETAILS: Your task is to write a program that takes a series of files and adds them to a single file. It should be able to add, remove, rename, and move files dynamically. Write a command-line program that accepts a series of command-argument pairs and performs the task specified by the command.

COMMANDS:

Add a new file (add file.txt)

Adds file.txt to aggregator.txt and deletes the original file.txt.
Remove a file (cut file.txt)

Removes file.txt from aggregator.txt and creates a separate file cut_file.txt with the same content as the original file.txt.
List all files (list)

Lists all the files present in aggregator.txt.
Create a copy of a file (copy file.txt)

Keeps file.txt in aggregator.txt and creates a copy of the original file.txt as copy_file.txt.
Rename a file (rename old_file.txt new_file.txt)

Renames old_file.txt to new_file.txt within aggregator.txt.
Move a file (move file.txt new_location)

Moves file.txt to a new location (new_location), keeping a reference in aggregator.txt.
Display content of a file (display file.txt)

Displays the content of file.txt from aggregator.txt.
FILES TO SUBMIT:

Source code file.
Snapshots of the terminal showing the flow of different scenarios.
NOTES:

All metadata required to perform these operations should also be stored in aggregator.txt.
You can safely assume that you only have text files.
